# Notes for Claude: mtgtribe.com (MTG 👑 | Your Digital Architect)

Brand rules live in MTG's "mtg-creative-standard" skill. No em or en dashes anywhere. Never publish or push live
without MTG's approval. Slogan, exactly: Let's Get This Crypto! 💪

## Reminder for MTG (saved 5 November 2026, at MTG's request)

**Remind MTG when the time comes.** Once these income-stream websites are finished:

- Bitcoin Wealth (bitcoinwealthpays.com), still being built
- ClickBaitPays, still being built
- JetUp · TAG Markets (mtgtribe.com/jetup), coming-soon page only, full guide still to build
- Bellver Affiliates (bellveraffiliates.com) is already finished

...come back and **remake the MTG TRIBE invite video** (both the 16:9 and the 9:16 version, see
`tools/invite-horizontal/`) so it mentions **every income stream MTG has at that point**, not only the ALTRUVA
guide it mentions today. Follow the dashboard order: 1 Bellver Affiliates, 2 JetUp · TAG Markets,
3 ClickBaitPays, 4 Bitcoin Wealth, 5 ALTRUVA.

MTG wants this video upgraded every time his income streams change, so it always reflects all of them.

Planning note: today the only stream MTG names out loud is ALTRUVA. Naming the others in his voice needs new lines in
his approved HeyGen voice "MTG Master Voice V2", which costs HeyGen credits:
ask MTG first. Without new voice lines they can be shown on screen only. Storyboard first, show a preview, never
publish without approval.

## Standing rule: how videos are shown on MTG's websites (MTG, 5 November 2026)

- **Vertical (9:16) videos** play inside a slim, premium phone frame: thin gold-titanium rim, thin black bezel,
  camera island, small side buttons. Never a cheap or bulky phone; the frame must not eat screen space.
- **Horizontal (16:9) videos** play inside a laptop frame, like the tutorials and explainers on bellveraffiliates.com.
- **When a video plays to the end, the player closes itself** (leaves full screen first) and goes back to its cover,
  like the Bellver players. Never make the viewer press close after watching the whole video.
- Reference implementation on mtgtribe.com: the invite pop-up in `index.html` (`#vm`, `.vm-vid.phone` / `.vm-vid.laptop`).
  Any link with `data-invite` opens it; `data-src`, `data-poster` and `data-orient="h"` play another video in it.
